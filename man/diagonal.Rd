\title{Constructor for a diagonal random effect}
\usage{
diagonal(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric covariate or a factor.}
}
\value{
A random effect with element \code{incidence.matrix} and a diagonal 
  \code{structure.matrix}
}
\description{
Builds a breedR random effect with an index incidence matrix and a diagonal 
covariance matrix, with one level for each value of \code{x}.
}
\details{
Uses sparse storage. It does not support nesting (yet). So it is not possible
to build random regression coefficients for each level of a grouping factor. 
This is in the TODO list.
