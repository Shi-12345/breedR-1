\usage{
loc_grid(coordinates, autofill)
}
\arguments{
\item{coordinates}{two-column matrix-like set of row and column coordinates 
of observational units}

\item{autofill}{logical. If TRUE (default) it will try to fill missing rows
or columns with missing observations. Otherwise, will treat individuals as
neighbours even if they are across an empty line.}
}
\value{
list of row and column coordinates of spatial units
  
  This functions converts observational coordinates into spatial coordinates.
  While in a observational dataset there can possibly be many or missing 
  observations at one single location, this function returns the list of row
  and column coordinates of a grid which contains all the observations
}
\description{
Returns a list row and column coordinates of observations
