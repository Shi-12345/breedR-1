\title{Default initial value for variance components}
\usage{
default_initial_variance(x, dim = 1, cor.trait = NULL, cor.effect = 0.1,
  digits = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric vector or matrix with the phenotypic observations. Each 
trait in one column.}

\item{dim}{integer. dimension of the random effect for each trait. Default is
1.}

\item{cor.trait}{a number strictly in (-1, 1). The initial value for the 
correlation across traits. Default is NULL, which makes the function to 
take the value from the data. See Details.}

\item{cor.effect}{a number strictly in (0, 1). The initial value for the
correlation across the different dimensions of the random effect. Default
is 0.1.}

\item{digits}{numeric. If not NULL (as default), the resulting matrix is rounded up
to 2 significant digits.}
}
\description{
A function of the response vector or matrix (multi-trait case) returning a
SPD matrix of conforming dimensions.
}
\details{
The default initial covariance matrix across traits is computed as half the 
empirical covariance kronecker times a Positive-Definite matrix with Compound
Symmetry Structure with a constant diagonal with value 1 and constant
off-diagonal elements with the positive value given by \code{cor.effect},
i.e. \deqn{\Sigma = Var(x)/2 \%*\% \psi(dim).} This implies that the default
initial \strong{correlations} across traits equal the empirical correlations,
except if \code{cor.trait} is not \code{NULL}.

\eqn{\psi(dim)} is intendend to model correlated random effects within
traits, and only has an effect when \code{dim} > 1.

If any column in \code{x} is constant (i.e. empirical variance of 0) then the
function stops. It is better to remove this trait from the analysis.

   ## acting independently over three traits
